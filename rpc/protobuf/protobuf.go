/*
	This folder contains all the protocol buffer definitions including
	the RPC Service definitions. You generate golang code by running:

	go generate -x github.com/djthorpe/sqlite/rpc/protobuf

	where you have installed the protoc compiler and the GRPC plugin for
	golang. In order to do that on a Mac:

	mac# brew install protobuf
	mac# go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

	On Debian Linux (including Raspian Linux) use the following commands
	instead:

	rpi# sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
	rpi# sudo apt install libprotobuf-dev
	rpi# go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
