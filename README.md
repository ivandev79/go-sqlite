# go-sqlite

This module provides an alternative interface for sqlite, including:

  * Opening in-memory databases and databases by file path;
  * Attaching and detaching databases by schema name;
  * Reflection on databases (schemas, tables, columns, indexes, etc);
  * Transactions (committing changes and rolling back on errors);
  * Executing arbitrary statements or building statements programmatically;
  * Reading results into a struct, map or slice.

Presently the module is in development and the API is subject to change.
